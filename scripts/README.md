# Utility Scripts

This folder is intended for utility scripts (e.g., build helpers, custom deployment commands, local tools).

- Place any scripts here that don't fit cleanly in the main backend, frontend, or infra directories.
- Add documentation/comments for any scripts as appropriate.

> **Note:**  
> This directory is optional and may be deleted or reorganized as needed.
