# Ticketing System Scaffold

This is a **starter scaffold** for the technical lead take-home assignment.  
**You are encouraged to reorganize, delete, or replace any files and directories here as you see fit.**  
Use your preferred frameworks, project structure, and tools.

## Directory Overview

- `backend/` — API server, authentication, data access, and related code/config.
- `frontend/` — Web client, routing, and UI/service integration.
- `infra/` — Infrastructure automation scripts/configurations (e.g., Terraform, shell).
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts for build, deployment, etc.
- `docker-compose.yaml` — Example local orchestration (optional; you can replace this with your preferred solution).

> **Note:**  
> This structure is only a starting point.  
> Please refer to the main assignment instructions for requirements and deliverables.

## Getting Started

See each subdirectory's `README.md` for details on expectations and placeholders.
