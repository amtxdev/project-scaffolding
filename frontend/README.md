# Frontend

This folder is intended for your web client scaffold.

## What to include

- Project manifest (e.g., `package.json`)
- Stubbed pages or components for:
  - Login
  - Event listing (public)
  - Ticket purchase (protected/gated)
- Service/API integration layer (can be stubbed or pseudocode)
- Clear folder organization for routing, logic, and shared utilities (feel free to reorganize)
- Build/run instructions for local development

## Integration & Build

- Show or describe the build → deployment flow.  
  No need for full CI/CD—documented build commands are sufficient.
- Ensure the frontend can be served locally by a new developer with minimal setup.

> **Note:**  
> You are free to reorganize, replace, or remove anything in this directory.
